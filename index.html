                                        I'm a Software Developer with a passion for coding. Born and raised in Florida,
                                        currently residing in Orlando. While most of my professional experience has been
                                        primarily focused on front-end development, my most recent job has got me hands
                                        on with dealing with the back-end and interacting with databases. In my free
                                        time, I'm
                                        learning new languages and tools and focusing on becoming a
                                        self-reliant Full Stack Developer.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Great at working with a team of people, but also able to throw on a set of
                                        headphones and clack away on the keyboard. A task-hungry problem-solver, I love
                                        being kept busy and having points and tickets piled up in my queue to be worked
                                        on.

                                        I like <strong>lifting weights</strong>, <strong>theme parks</strong>, and
                                        <strong>video games</strong>.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I started lifting weights in high school, where my obsession with picking things
                                        up and putting them down started to snowball. At my peak, I was going at least 5
                                        times a week, with each session was at <strong>minimum</strong> 2 hours. Things
                                        have slowed down to about 2-3 times a week, with sessions being around 30
                                        minutes to and hour, but I can still throw around some weight!
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        Growing up an hour from Orlando, I visited the theme parks about once a year.
                                        Now I have both a Disney and Universal annual pass and go to both fairly
                                        regularly. The single trip a year has turned into multiple trips a month.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I had a controller in my hand before I turned a year old. Sure, it was
                                        upside-down,
                                        and yeah, my mom had to help me push the buttons, but I still kept coming back.
                                        I think it's a fairly common dream of many modern software developers to have
                                        started in the industry with aspirations to building up the next Mario.
                                        Nowadays, it's more so about playing and enjoying them, but in the future,
                                        potentially making
                                        them.

                                        of theme parks and planning, but my fear not knowing what to
                                        expect on a ride I haven't done before.</p>
                                    <p class="card-text">The idea behind the site is simple: aggregate what people think
                                        about how intense rides are. Users can make an account, then leave ratings and
                                        comments on rides in both the Disney World and Universal Orlando theme parks.
                                        This project is still early in the works, and I'm using it to teach myself
                                        Node.js and MongoDB.</p>

                                        requests, and more. Development is primarily done using vanilla JavaScript,

                                    <p class="card-text">My personal responsibilities includes developing new code and
                                        fixing existing features, moving the code along our development cycle. Many new
                                        hires get sent my way if they run into any hurdles or have any questions. It's
                                        also not uncommon for tricky issues to be sent my way. I attend numerous
                                        customer demos, where I not only demonstrated my own code changes, but sometimes
                                        even features others have developed. Sprint by sprint, I am consistently one of
                                        the top performers.</p>

                                    <p class="card-text">Newscycle Solutions (now Naviga) offers many different
                                        solutions for companies in the news media industry. I specifically worked on
                                        SalesLink, a Software as a Service version of their legacy product NCS
                                        Advertising. SalesLink helped provide news media businesses a way to sale
                                        advertising space in both digital and print mediums.</p>
                                    <p class="card-text">I spent my time at Newscycle Solutions developing the front-end
                                        pieces of SalesLink. When it came to ensuring the mobile version of SalesLink
                                        was running smoothly, I was the go-to developer. SalesLink was used
                                        internationally, so we needed to provide language support for regions we were
                                        selling to. The localization of the entire site was also on my shoulders, so I
                                        was responsible that the content for each supported language was set in place.
                                        For nearly a year, I was the lead, and sole, Front End Developer for the entire
                                        SalesLink development team.</p>
